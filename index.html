        <h3>👩‍🚀 From Sci-Fi Enthusiast to Self-Taught Technologist</h3>
        <p>
          Ever since childhood, I’ve been mesmerized by the futuristic worlds of sci-fi movies —
          those glowing screens, intelligent systems, and data-driven heroes. 💡  
          I saw myself among them — a <span class="highlight">digital problem solver</span> who could shape the future with code.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first dream? ✈️ To soar the skies as a pilot.  
          But when that path dimmed due to finances and lack of opportunity, I looked to another sky — the digital one.  
          Technology became my cockpit — a place where <strong>skills, curiosity, and courage</strong> mattered more than credentials.

        <h3>💻 From Education Admin to Tech Innovator</h3>
        <p>
          My professional journey took off at <strong>Sitoromo Primary School</strong>, where I worked as an
          <strong>Education Assistant in ICT</strong>.  
          What began as supporting teachers quickly turned into leading change — integrating
          tech in classrooms, optimizing LMS platforms, and ensuring ICT tools ran smoothly for both learners and educators.
        </p>
        <p>
          From <span class="highlight">data management</span> to <span class="highlight">system audits</span>,
          I became the go-to person for anything digital.  
          This experience transformed me — showing how <strong>a few lines of code</strong> could solve real problems
          and boost efficiency in ways I never imagined.

        <h3>🧠 Becoming a Self-Taught Programmer</h3>
        <p>
          When formal studies weren’t possible, I decided to write my own syllabus.  
          I immersed myself in online learning, open-source projects, and late-night debugging sessions —  
          turning curiosity into capability, and capability into confidence. ⚡
