💡 Design & Code Insights

The design I chose is inspired by sci-fi aesthetics, reflecting my love for futuristic visuals, glowing effects, and interactive experiences. Each element and line of code was intentionally crafted to create a cohesive story and an engaging user journey.

✨ Visual Inspiration

I used a starry, glowing background to represent curiosity, exploration, and endless possibilities, values that drive me as a programmer. The glow brings the interface to life, creating a sense of motion and discovery.

I also wrote custom JavaScript to generate floating stars that move and twinkle across the screen. Each star is randomly positioned to create a natural, scattered look that mimics a real night sky, reinforcing the sci-fi ambiance.

Animation: Using @keyframes floatStar and twinkle, stars slowly rise and fade in and out, creating depth and movement. It is more than decoration, it is an experience.

I wanted my projects to shine without distraction, so I used clean sections, balanced spacing, and glowing hover effects. Subtle animations and smooth scrolling make every interaction feel fluid and modern.

🎨 Key HTML & CSS Choices

I structured the portfolio into clear sections — About, Skills, Projects, and Future Goals, making it both visually organized and semantically meaningful.

Glowing text and highlights reflect my sci-fi inspiration and help guide the user’s eye to key content.

Project cards (.project-card) feature soft shadows and hover transitions that give a sense of depth and interactivity. It is subtle, but it makes each project feel tangible, like something you can reach out and explore.

⚙️ Interactive JavaScript Elements

Scroll-based effects: I implemented small scroll-triggered animations that adjust the appearance of elements dynamically such as sticky headers. These effects make the page feel alive as users navigate.

Responsive adjustments: The JavaScript also ensures smooth responsiveness. Star positions, project cards, and animations adapt to smaller screens, keeping the experience consistent across all devices.

🌌 Why These Choices Matter

Every effect, glow, and animation was chosen to:

Highlight my projects and skills without distraction.

Reflect my personality and inspiration — sci-fi, curiosity, and tech-driven creativity.

Create a memorable experience for visitors, where every scroll and hover feels intentional.

This section explains not just what my code does, but why I made those choices, blending functionality, aesthetics, and storytelling into one cohesive portfolio.

NB: There is still room for improvement in both this portfolio and the projects linked within it, I view it as a living project that grows with my skills.
